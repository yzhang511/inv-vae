## invariant variational auto-encoding

This repo contains code for running the model in the paper: [Motion-Invariant Variational Auto-Encoding of Brain Structural Connectomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04535).

Note that this model is not limited to removing motion from the brain imaging data. You can adopt the code to remove the effects of arbitrary nuisance variables on your data.

## Installation
create conda environment and install packages:
```
conda create -n inv_vae python=3.8
pip install -e.
```
